We don't want to add any kind of burden on children but make them feel that how much they can learn when they are doing things by their own. The spirit of play is in the heart of our Literacy. Children play with letters, words and numbers. The classroom is a playful arena. Children enter this arena with open hearts and minds. It is our primary goal to keep the spirit alive. As a result learning to read and write is exciting and fun. A specially designed curriculum with innovative methods and necessary tools are followed to lay a very strong foundation for the little ones equipping them to face the real world.</p>

                        <p> Student appearance, as well as behavior, reflects values taught at Angle Convent School. Our primary objective is to have students dress neatly, modestly, and in such a manner that does not attract attention to the individual, but encourages a climate conducive to learning. Children will become involved in a range of activities, both physical and creative. Clothes will inevitably become dirty through your child’s involvement in activities. Comfortable but easily washable clothing is important so that your child can confidently take part in these activities. We will always help the children, but simple clothing which they can handle themselves will give them their own independence. Therefore please do not send your child in clothes that you do not want spoilt.</p>
                        <p> Angel Convent School has a School Uniform Policy. Children are encouraged to wear their school uniform, which consists of a Yellow shirt with red-black-blue checks printed on their collar, red-black-blue checks pants for Boys and Yellow shirt with red-black-blue checks printed on their collar red-black-blue checks skirts for Girls. The school uniforms are available for purchase from the school itself. We encourage uniforms to be worn on excursions to allow for easy identification.</p>
                        <p>  Please make sure footwear worn is suitable for our active environment, thongs and slippers are not allowed. Children will be asked to remove their shoes if they are not according to the rules of schools. We encourage independence so shoes that your child can manage themselves are preferred. Parents are asked to provide a bag with a change of clothes in for your child that is always here on the sessions your child attends. This is so that if there is any occasion when your child’s clothes become wet for any reason e.g. spilt drink, water play, we can change your child so they are comfortable.</p>
